# Being a Cube: The Game

This is a game in which you live the life of an ordinary cube.

The project is being developed during Twitch streaming sessions, that take place on every Saturday. The progress of each session is captured shortly into videos on YouTube. All information is available on the Telegram channel, including announcements, progress reports and future plans.
